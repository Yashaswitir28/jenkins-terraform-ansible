# Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with automated deployment pipelines

# Objective
To design and implement an automated infrastructure deployment pipeline that eliminates manual provisioning, reduces deployment time, and ensures consistency across environments.

# Problem Statement
Traditional infrastructure management involves:

•	Manual server provisioning leading to human errors

•	Inconsistent configurations across environments

•	Time-consuming deployment processes

•	Difficulty in scaling infrastructure

•	Lack of version control for infrastructure changes

•	Complex rollback procedures

# Solution Approach
# Implement Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with automated deployment pipelines to achieve:

•	Codified infrastructure that can be version controlled

•	Automated, repeatable deployments

•	Self-service infrastructure provisioning

•	Rapid environment creation and destruction
•	Comprehensive monitoring and logging
•	Disaster recovery capabilities
